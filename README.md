# a99-Team-27 Productivity Tracker

## Summary 

In this web application, we wanted to create a way to promote overall wellness/productivity. We attempted to promote this by suggesting a list of activities/exercises that the user can choose to do daily. The activities that are performed can be checked and logged, which will keep track of how many times you perform a certain activity. This will allow the user to reflect on their overall productivity to visualize how often they perform tasks related to their mental/physical health. 


## Setup

1. Clone this repository using git clone and the SSH link
2. Run the command ```npm install``` to install the needed dependencies (the dependencies used include: express, sqlite3, md5, body-parser, minimist)
3. Run ```npm run start```
4. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser to view our web application


## Team mangement

Our planning and work division (member roles) can be found in this file: [planning](https://github.com/comp426-2022-fall/a99-Team-27/blob/main/docs/management.md)


## Instructions

To use our application, create a new user account under the Registration section. Next, log in with the username and password you created and click submit. To log your activity progress simply check the boxes of the activities you completed and click submit. A log of the number of times you completed the activities will display below. 

## Future Advancements

In the future, this can be expanded upon by encouraging users to do the activities more. One way to foster encouragement could be to provide the user with rewards after they complete wellness activities a certain amount of times, which will promote positive reinforcement.
