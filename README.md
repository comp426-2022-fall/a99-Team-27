# a99-Team-27 Productivity Tracker

## Summary 

In this web application, we wanted to create a way to promote overall wellness/productivity. We attempted to promote this by suggesting a list of activities/exercises that the user can choose to do daily. The activities that are performed can be checked and logged, which will keep track of how many times you perform a certain activity. This will allow the user to reflect on their overall productivity to visualize how often they perform tasks related to their mental/physical health. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository using git clone and the SSH link
2. Run the command ```npm install``` to install the needed dependencies (the dependencies used include: express, sqlite3, md5, body-parser, minimist)
3. Run ```npm run start```
4. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser to view our web application

## First steps

Other steps that you will need to take after your team has accepted the assignment:

1. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly. 
2. Edit this README.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to information contained under `/docs/`.
3. Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc.
4. Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository as administrators.
5. Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and user them to manage your project.
7. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this README.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.
9. Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 
10. Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project.

## Team mangement

Our planning and work division can be found in this file: [planning](https://github.com/comp426-2022-fall/a99-Team-27/blob/main/docs/management.md)

Plan to meet with your team ASAP.
Talk through identifying roles within your team.

Try to figure out what each of you are good at/enjoy doing and try to work out roles that incorporate that.

Some basic roles you will want to consider:

1. A review manager - someone to review pull requests and merge or reject them and manage the related discussions
2. A plan manager - someone to keep an eye on the overall plan and keep the project tab/to-do list up to date
3. A documentation manager - someone to keep the documentation in order and identify what is missing and needs to be documented
4. A release manager - someone to manage the packaging and release process for your prototype package
5. A project manager - someone keeping track of all the moving parts and make sure that everything that needs to happen is happening.
5. Roles for team members to take charge or different parts of the project. Possible roles:
    1. Front end lead
    2. Back end lead
    3. Database lead
    4. Design lead
    5. Etc.

You will notice that there are more roles than people in your group.
That is because you will all be doing a hybrid job of managing a thing while working on other things.

## Instructions

To use our application, create a new user account under the Registration section. Next, log in with the username and password you created and click submit. To log your activity progress simply check the boxes of the activities you completed and click submit. A log of the number of times you completed the activities will display below. 

## Future Advancements

In the future, this can be expanded upon by encouraging users to do the activities more. One way to foster encouragement could be to provide the user with rewards after they complete wellness activities a certain amount of times, which will promote positive reinforcement.
